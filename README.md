# GitLab Webhook Body

You can integrate the <a href="https://api.spontit.com">Spontit API</a> with GitLab webhooks. For instructions on how to do so, see <a href="todo">here</a>.

We use the function in `get_gitlab_webhook_body.py` on our server to generate the body of the notification. 

If you use the Spontit API and want us to format the body differently, or improve the way we format the body and generate the description, simply <a href="https://github.com/spontit/gitlab-webhook-string/compare" target="_blank">create a pull request</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spontit/gitlab-webhook-string/issues/new" target="_blank">issue</a> and we'll review it. If it all checks out, we'll test it and update our server. 

We GREATLY appreciate all additions.
